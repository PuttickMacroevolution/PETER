Run all simulations presented in Puttick et al. 2020, "The complex effects of mass extinctions on morphological disparity"

# Generate trees and traits with no mass extinction.
	no.extinction.simulation.R
 
# Generate trees and traits with a mass extinction with directional trait selection. 
# This file also contains the data to run used in further examples.
	directional.mass.extinction.R

# Generate trees and traits with a mass extinction with disruptive trait selection.
	disruptive.mass.extinction.R

# Generate trees and traits with directional trait selection on speciation and
# extinction during background times
	directional.background.extinction.R

# Generate trees and traits with disruptive trait selection on speciation and
# extinction during background times.
	disruptive.mass.extinction.R
