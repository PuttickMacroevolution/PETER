}
\arguments{
\item{lambda}{Speciation rate}

\item{mu}{Extinction rate. If mu=0, then the simulation follows a Yule pure birth process}

\item{time.limit}{the point at which to end the simulation measured from the origin of the process (time 0). Must be > 0.}

\item{time.limit.mass.ext}{the point at which mass extinction occurs, not applicable if mass.ext.occ=FALSE}

\item{mass.ext.quantile}{The cut-off for the trait values selected for extinction during the mass extinction event. Values above mass.ext.quantile will be marked for loss during the mass extinction event.}

\item{n.characters}{the number of trait characters to simulate under a Brownian motion process}

\item{sigma.rates}{Either a vector or matrix specifying the rates of character evolution. If a vector then all traits evolve independently, and values are recylced if the length is less than n.characters. If a square matrix, this specifies the relative rates (diagonals) and correlation between traits (off-diagonals)}

\item{spp.size.prob}{Probability of lineages with smaller trait values splitting during 'background' times. If the value is 0 then all lineages have an equal probability of splitting; larger values mean lineages with smaller trait values are more likely to split, and values < 0 mean lineages with larger trait values are more likely to split}

\item{ext.size.prob}{Probability of lineages with larger trait values going extinct during 'background' times. If the value is 0 then all lineages have an equal probability of extinction; larger values mean lineages with larger trait values are more likely to go extinct, and values < 0 mean lineages with smaller trait valyes are more likely to go extinct}

\item{larger.than}{Logical. If TRUE, then mass extinction selection occurs on traits larger than the proportion indicated by 'mass.ext.quantile'. If FALSE, the smaller traits are selected for extinction}

\item{mass.ext.occ}{Logical specifying if a mass extinction occurs at the time given by time.limit.mass.ext (default = TRUE).}

\item{mass.ext.severity}{the proportion of lineages that succumb to extinction, not applicable if mass.ext.occ=FALSE}

\item{trait.axes}{If univariate.selection=FALSE, the trait axes on which selection will occur. The default (NULL) acts on all trait axes}

\item{chance.of.random}{Numeric. A value to specify the 'selectivity' of extinction. If chance.of.random=0 only lineages with trait values above or below the limit specified by mass.ext.quantile will go extinct. Values > 0 and < 1 indicate the trait is selected for with decreasing strength, until chance.of.random = 1 at which point all lineages are equally likely to go extinct so there is no selection according to trait values.}

\item{upperBound}{The upper bound allowed for trait values. Trait space can be constrained by specifying a value rather than then default (Inf)}

\item{lowerBound}{The lower bound allowed for trait values. Trait space can be constrained by specifying a value rather than then default (-Inf)}

\item{return.trait.matrix}{Logical. If TRUE the values at internal and external nodes is returned in a matrix corresponding to the APE phylo edge format}

\item{return.branch.value.list}{Logical. Returns a list with all trait values at every time point. Default is FALSE as TRUE can results in huge files}

\item{return.time.list}{Logical. Returns a list with every time points at which the simulation ran. Default is FALSE as TRUE can results in huge files}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\itemize{
\item {phy} {The output phylogeny}
\item {root.state} {value(s) for trait(s) at the root}
\item {trait.matrix} {List of trait values at all internal nodes and tips on the phylogeny. If n.characters > 1, then there are list entries for each trait value}
\item {branch.value.list.out} {The value of traits at each time unit in the simulation. Each list element corresponds to the edge in the phy$edge matrix, and the time given by time.list.out}
\item {vtt} {The variance measured at each node of the phylogeny to give 'variance-through-time' data. Only returned if return.through.time=TRUE}
\item {ltt} {The number of lineages measured at each node of the phylogeny to give 'lineage-through-time' data. Only returned if return.through.time=TRUE}
\item {vtt.extant} {The variance measured at each node of the phylogeny to give 'variance-through-time' data based on lineages that survive to present only. Only returned if return.through.time.extant=TRUE}
\item {ltt.extant} {The number of lineages measured at each node of the phylogeny to give 'lineage-through-time' data based on lineages that survive to present only. Only returned if return.through.time.extant=TRUE}
}

\description{
Simulates a birth-death phylogeny with simultaneous evolution under Brownian motion for one or more traits. The simulations continue until a certain time has elapsed since the start of the process. Additionaly, a mass extinction can occur with a user-set intensity of extinction after a certain time within the process. Traits can be correlated or independent, can be linked to increased rates of speciation and/or extinction at background times, and can drive selectivity at mass extinction event.
